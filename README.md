Simpson Characters Classification using LittleVGG 
Context
As a big Simpsons fan, I have watched a lot (and still watching) of The Simpson episodes -multiple times each- over the years. I wanted to build a neural network which can recognize characters. Feel free to check and recommend my Medium post Part 1 on a classification model and Part 2 on a detection model (Faster R-CNN) about this dataset and what I am doing with it. You can also find the related GitHub repo here .

Content
I am still building this dataset (labeling pictures), I will upload new versions of this dataset. Please check the files there are descriptions and explanations.

File simpson-set.tar.gz : This is an image dataset: 20 folders (one for each character) with 400-2000 pictures in each folder.

File simpson-test-set.zip. : Preview of the image dataset

File weights.best.h5 : Weights computed, in order to predict in Kernels.

File annotation.txt : Annotation file for bounding boxes for each character

Acknowledgements
If someone wants to contribute and make this dataset bigger and more relevant, any help will be appreciated.

Data is directly taken and labeled from TV show episodes.

Feel free to check and recommend my Medium post Part 1 on a classification model and Part 2 on a detection model (Faster R-CNN) about this dataset and what I am doing with it. You can also find the related GitHub repo here .

Inspiration
Can you tell the difference between Maggie Simpson and Lisa Simpson? Was that Lenny Leonard or was that Carl Carlson?
